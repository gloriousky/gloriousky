  Hello, I'm David. I have a gentle personality and enjoy exploring the unknown. I am always seeking to find the root cause of problems and their solutions. To me, work is not just a job, but also an opportunity to grow and thrive.

Currently, I work as a frontend engineer at a startup company. My main responsibilities include web development, communicating with PMs to clarify requirements, collaborating with backend developers to integrate APIs, testing product compatibility on different devices and browsers. I have worked on projects related to live streaming and sports events.

My current project mainly utilizes WebSocket, Vue3, Nuxt3, TypeScript, and is deployed using Docker. I believe in the principles of Clean Code and strive to develop components with low coupling and high scalability. I am also passionate about Functional programming!
